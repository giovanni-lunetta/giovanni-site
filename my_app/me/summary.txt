My name is Giovanni Lunetta. I’m a Data Scientist in the Technology Leadership Development Program (TLDP) at Johnson & Johnson, based in New Jersey, where I focus on building data and AI solutions for real-world healthcare and commercial problems.

I graduated from the University of Connecticut with a B.A. in Statistics and Political Science and an M.S. in Data Science, and I enjoy combining rigorous analytics with clear storytelling and business impact.

Outside of work, I’m a huge sports fan—especially football and basketball—a die-hard New York Knicks supporter, and a proud UConn Huskies basketball fan. I’m always excited to talk about data, products, sports, and the intersection of technology and everyday life.
