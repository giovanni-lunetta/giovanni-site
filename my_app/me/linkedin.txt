Giovanni Lunetta
Data Scientist | Healthcare AI | TLDP @ J&J
Pompton, New Jersey, United States
Summary
I build production AI and data systems in healthcare — GenAI
platforms, ML pipelines, and cloud automation that drive real
business outcomes.
At J&J (Technology Leadership Development Program, Data &
Decision Science), my work spans GenAI document intelligence,
unsupervised preference modeling for surgical workflows, enterprise
AWS cost optimization, and ML pipeline validation at scale. I care
about shipping things that get adopted, not just built.
Outside of work, I build too: giovannilunetta.com runs a self-
evaluating dual-LLM system I architected, and MemSavr is a macOS
app I shipped with Apple code signing. M.S. in Data Science from
UConn.
Always happy to connect with people working on applied AI — let's
talk.
Experience
Johnson & Johnson
Technology LDP Analyst
June 2024 - Present (1 year 9 months)
Raritan, New Jersey, United States
GenAI Document Automation: Built a document intelligence platform using
hybrid retrieval (pgvector + BM25), LLM agents, and schema-based extraction
— achieving 50% token reduction and enabling faster, more reliable regulatory
document processing.
Pre-Surgical Configuration Analytics: Designed unsupervised preference
models (Fuzzy C-Means) achieving 67% surgical classification (+17 over
baseline). Delivered Tableau dashboards adopted for clinical decision support.

AWS Cost Optimization: Architected a 3-Lambda event-driven pipeline
eliminating 200+ hours/year of manual processing, with multi-million dollar cost
attribution at 85%+ coverage.
ML Pipeline Validation: Validated a 14-node Kedro ML pipeline (1.3M+
records, XGBoost, ROC-AUC 0.717) with scalability assessment across
multiple therapeutic indications.
HCP Segmentation: Built provider segmentation models (90+ features, K-
Means/Fuzzy C-Means) and treatment-pattern analytics to inform commercial
targeting strategy.
Microsoft 365 Copilot Program: Managed enterprise pilot for 877 users with
automated lifecycle workflows (Python + Excel macros), reducing processing
time by 50%.
