Data Scientist with 2+ years of experience in healthcare and commercial analytics, focused on machine learning, 
advanced analytics, and AI applications. Proven track record delivering measurable business impact: built GenAI 
document automation with 50% token reduction, automated pipelines saving 200+ hours annually, and attributed 
multi-million dollars in AWS costs at 85%+ coverage. Strong skills in Python, AWS, machine learning (XGBoost, 
clustering, statistical modeling), with experience in LLMs and GenAI systems, product ownership, and cross-
functional collaboration.
WORK EXPERIENCE
Technology LDP Analyst on Data (Data & Decision Science), 
Johnson & Johnson (MedTech R&D)
06/2024 – Current | Raritan, NJ
•GenAI Document Automation (Document AI/RAG): Built GenAI-powered automation for Clinical Evaluation 
Report (CER) extraction with semantic search and schema validation, achieving 50% token reduction through 
optimized document embedding strategies and LLM cleaning agents. Implemented production document 
intelligence system with quality assurance workflows.
•Pre-Surgical Configuration Analytics (Preference Modeling): Designed and validated unsupervised preference 
models (Fuzzy C-Means + rule-based logic), achieving 67% surgical classification (+17 points over baseline) across 
10 iterative refinements with 4 independent feature sets (silhouette score 0.66). Delivered comprehensive Tableau 
dashboard (6+ iterations) adopted for clinical decision support and commercial strategy.
•AWS Cost Optimization (FinOps): Architected 3-Lambda event-driven pipeline automating cost data management
—eliminating 200+ hours annually of manual processing. Achieved multi-million dollar cost attribution across 
enterprise AWS infrastructure at 85%+ coverage with self-service dashboards enabling data-driven optimization 
decisions.
•Persistency Model (ML Pipeline Validation): Validated end-to-end 14-node Kedro ML pipeline for biologic drug 
persistency modeling (1.3M+ records processed, XGBoost, ROC-AUC 0.717). Conducted comprehensive pipeline 
review including architecture documentation, feature analysis, and scalability assessment across multiple 
therapeutic indications using advanced claims analytics.
•HCP Segmentation & Treatment Analytics: Performed unsupervised clustering analysis on healthcare provider 
data with 90+ engineered features using K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means (silhouette score 0.42), validated with ANOVA 
and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Developed treatment-pattern analytics identifying priority healthcare providers for 
commercial targeting, delivering actionable HCP personas and insights adopted by field teams.
•Microsoft 365 Copilot Program (Product Operations): Managed enterprise pilot program, provisioning 877 users 
with automated lifecycle workflows (Python + Excel macros) that reduced processing time by 50%. Built daily 
reporting system serving as single source of truth for program leadership, enabling data-driven license allocation 
decisions.
Technology Summer Intern (Data Science), 
Johnson & Johnson (Janssen Pharmaceuticals)
05/2023 – 08/2023 | Titusville, NJ
•Developed a machine learning model using healthcare claims data to predict patient drug eligibility 6 months in 
advance, optimizing doctor outreach targeting and pharmaceutical processes.

PROJECTS
AI Portfolio Assistant (Self-Evaluating LLM System)
•Architected production conversational AI using GPT-4o-mini and Gemini 2.0 Flash featuring automated quality 
control, function calling for lead capture, and self-improving feedback loop. Implemented evaluation retry loop 
with dual-model assessment (generation vs. evaluation) and JSONL-based analytics for continuous improvement. 
Deployed via Gradio at giovannilunetta.com .
DateBack (macOS Application)
•Built production macOS desktop app (Electron + Python) processing Snapchat exports (50GB+) with EXIF date 
restoration, batched cloud streaming, and Apple code signing. Demonstrates full-stack engineering and 
professional distribution workflows (notarization, auto-updates, DMG installer) with 100% offline-first 
architecture.
